            <h1 class="display-4">Hello There,</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                Welcome to my brand new App Work Management System. It's Just a mock app based on real UK client
                project. So let's talk
                more about this app. It's basically a simple CRUD App that is built up using following tech stack such
                as NodeJS for backend environment , ExpressJS for HTTP Server and MongoDB for the database .Thus I have
                used here to create a frontend part using traditional HTML5. CSS3 and vanila JS and Boootstrap CSS
                framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here Work Management System has defined two roles where one is for Manager works as a contractor has
                role of "Admin" and other one is for empolyee or worker has role of emp, whom assign a job by the
                Manager or Contractor for
                a required work gets from the client.
            </p>
            <p>
                So Manager has a reponsibility to assign a job to the employee and regular monitor the daily activities
                of employee . whenever employee starts their work following steps.
            <ul>
                <li> Daily Login to Employee Dashboard</li>
                <li>Check the task or work which is provided by the Manager.</li>
                <li>before start the work they have to click on "ClockIn" button to record the time when they start
                    their daily job.</li>
                <li>Similar there is given couple of other buttons for following activities such as for "Intreval
                    Breaks" and "ClockOut" when they would done their first day task. </li>
            </ul>
            And These all activities can be seen by the Manager in Admin Dashboard . Admin can see/modify all the
            things.
            </p>
